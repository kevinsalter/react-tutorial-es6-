## React Tutorial (ES6+)

I'm wondering if it'd be useful to use a super-small app like this as a living styleguide that we can all comment on and contribute to while we hash out our team's internal standard way of writing React apps.

###### install deps

`npm install`

###### start front-end

`npm start`

###### run Node.js server (for persisting comments)

`npm run server`



## Some discussion points around writing [React Components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html)

- [ ] `React.createClass` or `class xxxxx extends React.Component` or both?
- [ ] aim for stateless components first?
- [ ] best practices for defining propTypes
- [ ] use of Container Components [article 1](https://medium.com/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005#.pero8m9gj) [article 2](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.br1zdslap)
